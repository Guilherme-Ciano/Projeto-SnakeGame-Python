# snake_game
I wanted to discover the features of the 'Pygame' module, so I decided to try to develop in a simple and practical way, the famous snake game.
ItÂ´s a simple code, so you can change whatever you want, like, change the song in game, change the colors, and everything.
It have some commentaries in portuguese(PtBR), in all code to help and guide.
